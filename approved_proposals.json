BREIF  OUTLINE  \n \nAutomation  of hydroponics  involves manipulating its control  variables such as  moisture  content,  humidity,  \ntemperature,  PH, TDS,  light intensity  etc.) to produce  the ideal  and optimum  environment  for any plant’s  \ngrowth  and nurturing.  The aim of hydroponics  automation  is to minimize  labor  cost and increase  production  \nsubstantially,  resulting  in economic  benefit  for our Country.  For this purpose,  we have  designed  hydroponic  \nsystem.  After  analysis  of different  types  of materials,  selection  of ideal  materials  was made  for this \napplication.  Electricity  is supplied  to our system  using  solar  panels.  Sensor  nodes  at different  places  in \nsystem  are installed  to provide  more  accurate  knowledge  about  our control  variables  so that optimum  \nadjustment  can be applied  to each  area in green  house).  By using  Arduino,  green  house  is automated  by \nsending  appropriate  instructions  to actuators  for adjusting  control  variables.  For example,  when  soil moisture  \nis low, it is enhanced  by using  water  sprinkler  system.  To notify  the user about  any emergency,  an IOT \nbased  system  has been  installed  to extract  data on web server  and an Android  app has also been  designed  \nfor control  and monitor  of the system.  The costs  of this project  is kept low without  compromising  on efficiency  \nand performance,  thus,  to provide  a solution  suitable  for both industry  and farmers.  The technique  used  in \nthis greenhouse  chamber  to grow  plants  is known  as hydroponics.  The hydroponics  technique  is usually  \nused  to grow  shallow  roots  plants  and leafy plants  such  as tomato,  capsicum,  cucumber,  spinach,  lettuce,  \nmint,  coriander,  strawberry  and other  such  kind of plants.  The main  goal of this project  is to create  a \ngreenhouse  chamber  that will produce  vegetables  and herbs  round  the year.  \nSIR SYED  UNIVERSITY  OF ENGINEERING  & TECHNOLOGY  \nCOMPUTER  ENGINEERING  DEPARTMENT  \nProposal  for the Final  Year  Project  Batch  2020   \n5.

The parameter  which  can monitored  is PH, TDSand  E . \n \nCONTROLLING: - \nThe controlling  of the whole  process  can be done  by using  Arduino  mega  2560  with the help of relay  modules.  \nThe dht22,  PH, TDS and water  level are attached  to them.  The growing  led are to be controlled  because  \nplants  don’t  need  light for 24 hours.  \nSIR SYED  UNIVERSITY  OF ENGINEERING  & TECHNOLOGY  \nCOMPUTER  ENGINEERING  DEPARTMENT  \nProposal  for the Final  Year  Project  Batch  2020   \n \n8.
